change system-auth to:
Add krb5 authentication in case pam_unix.so fails;
Add kerberos tickets fix (make them owned by user);
Add firefox to session opening;
Add a script to create a user (createUser) at the start of gdm-password to create kerberos users.
Add a script to eliminate user (cleanUser) at the end of session (close_session)

Add
forwardable = true
In /etc/krb5.conf (under libdefaults)

GDM:
https://ask.fedoraproject.org/question/9875/how-do-i-disable-user-list-in-gdm/
Make sure to set disable-button-restart to false. For whatever reason, if not specified, it gets disabled. We don't want that (allows us to restart or shutdown from login menu).
In /usr/share/xsessions are the sessions that GDM looks at. Just move all but gnome-classic

Run script on authentication/etc.
pam_exec
Use following script for fixKRBTickets:
#!/bin/sh
FILES=/tmp/krb5cc_athena_$PAM_USER_*
for f in $FILES
do
	chown $PAM_USER $f
done
exit 0;
on session open.

Certificate stealer
Put the following script in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d
#!/bin/sh
# Test if it's not one of the system users
for u in root alpha
do
	if [ "$USER" == "$u" ]
	then
		exit 0;
	fi
done

# In case we are in open_session copy over the firefox profile
mkdir -p /home/$USER/.mozilla;
cd /home/$USER/.mozilla;
rm -Rf firefox;
ssh -K linux.mit.edu "cd ~/.mozilla; tar cvzf - firefox" | tar zxvf -;

Should be improved with some intelligence - this overwrites the firefox profile with the one on athena on every login.

ARCH network notes:
Use wpa_supplicant
Don't use ifplugd. Use dhcpcd. Don't use dhcpcd@eth0 or dhcpcd@wlan0. Only the dhcpcd service should be enabled.

Note: this should all be in /etc/skel!
Desktop with icons:
Use dconf-editor and go to org->gnome->desktop->background->show-desktop-icons

Python/IDLE:
Remember to alias python2 to python in case we are still using 2.7!

Gnome:
Maybe include the gnome cheat sheet?

Mouse considerations:
Enable disable while typing and tap to click (mouse settings on gnome)
